###### Low-poly style wallpaper I made in 2017

Took the time to finish up this website, saving a snapshot here in case I ever change it. Primary motivation behind this was to finally rehouse all of my projects, the last time I tried to index all of my projects I ended up collecting all the data but didn't end up turning it into a website. (Although I did make a [list of all my repositories](https://mcrocks999.github.io/repos.html) at one point!)

###### A Project Page

The site is built with next.js and everything is designed in order to allow me to do a static export and just upload it on to my web server. You can see the [project details here](/project/website) or the [repository here](https://gitlab.insrt.uk/insert/website). All the posts and project descriptions are rendered using Markdown to make my life easier.
